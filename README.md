<h2>📋 Project Overview</h2>
This project is a continuation of the Company Layoffs Data Cleaning initiative. Having cleaned and prepared the dataset using MySQL, this phase focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and insights from global layoffs across industries, countries, and time periods.

The goal is to support informed decision-making, storytelling, and reporting by using SQL to explore the dataset thoroughly and answer key business questions.
